# 🚀 Packet Rush

A fast-paced terminal-based puzzle game where you play as a network router managing packet flow!

## 🎮 Game Concept

Direct chaotic data packets to their correct destination ports by switching network junctions. As the game progresses, speed and complexity increase until your network experiences a "kernel panic" (game over).

## 🏗️ Implementation Status

### ✅ **COMPLETED - GAME IS FULLY PLAYABLE!**
- **✅ Core Game Engine**: Complete Bubble Tea integration with real-time gameplay
- **✅ Junction System**: Interactive junction switching with visual feedback (keys 1-4)
- **✅ Packet Management**: Smart packet spawning, movement, and collision detection
- **✅ Scoring System**: Points for correct routing, lives for mistakes
- **✅ Game Controls**: Pause (SPACE), Quit (Q), Restart (R), Junction switching (1-4)
- **✅ Visual Interface**: Real-time display with animated junctions and packet movement
- **✅ Progressive Difficulty**: Spawn rate increases over time
- **✅ Game Over**: "Kernel panic" when lives run out

## 🚀 **Current Features - FULLY WORKING GAME!**

- **Real-time Gameplay**: Smooth packet movement and junction switching
- **Interactive Controls**: Keys 1-4 switch junction directions, SPACE pauses, Q quits
- **Smart Routing**: Packets follow junction directions and reach destination ports
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for correct deliveries, lose lives for mistakes
- **Progressive Challenge**: Game speed increases over time
- **Visual Feedback**: Junctions show direction arrows (→ ↓ ↑), packets display as letters
- **Game States**: Play, pause, game over with restart capability

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

- **Packets**: Different types (Data, Audio, Video, Email) with unique destinations
- **Junctions**: Switchable routing points controlled by keyboard (keys 1-9)
- **Scoring**: Points for correct routing, penalties for mistakes
- **Lives System**: Limited chances before "kernel panic"
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed increases as score grows

## 🔧 Building & Running

```bash
# Build the game
go build -o packet-rush.exe .

# Run the game
./packet-rush.exe
```

## 🎮 Controls - WORKING NOW!

- **1-4**: Switch junction routes (watch the arrows change: → ↓ ↑)
- **SPACE**: Pause/Resume
- **Q**: Quit game  
- **R**: Restart (when game over)

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Watch packets spawn** from `S` as letters: `D`, `A`, `V`, `E`
2. **Each packet has a destination** port (1, 2, 3, or 4)
3. **Switch junctions** using keys 1-4 to route packets correctly
4. **Score points** for successful deliveries (10 points each)
5. **Lose lives** for wrong deliveries or lost packets
6. **Survive as long as possible** before "KERNEL PANIC!"
